This dataset gives the yield of peas in pounds per plot, based on four factors: in which block the plot was located (labeled 1 through 6), and whether nitrogen (N), phosphate (P) or potassium (K) was applied to the soil (1 = applied, 0 = not applied). There are 24 plots, 4 per block. Since not all 8 (but only 4) combinations of levels of N, P and K are represented for each block, this is incomplete block design, but balanced in the sense that within each block each soil additive is received by two plots. Our main question of interest is whether nitrogen N has an eﬀect on yield.\n",

In this light, for the resulting model from d) perform a mixed eﬀects analysis, modeling the block variable as a random eﬀect by using the function lmer.
